Thought: The search results for Gallifant et al. 2024 (reference 30) indicate that LLMs show a *drop* in performance when brand and generic drug names are swapped, suggesting fragility, not "near-perfect factual recall ability to match these drugs’ generic and brand names" as stated in the current paper. This is a significant discrepancy that needs to be highlighted. The current paper states "Our previous work showed that all models evaluated here have near-perfect factual recall ability to match these drugs’ generic and brand names30." This seems to be a misrepresentation or oversimplification of the findings in reference 30. Reference 30 actually states "Language models show a 1-10% performance drop on medical benchmarks when brand and generic drug names are swapped, possibly due to pre-training data contamination." This implies that while they *can* match them, their performance is *fragile* and not "near-perfect" when challenged with swapped names, which is precisely the context of the current paper's investigation into illogical requests. This is a critical point for the "Genuine novelty and intellectual contribution" and "Logical consistency" criteria.

I have now verified three key claims:
1.  **RABBITS30 dataset**: Confirmed its existence and relevance to drug name mappings.
2.  **PERSIST instruction-tuning dataset**: Confirmed its public availability on Hugging Face.
3.  **Reference 30's findings**: Found a discrepancy between the paper's claim of "near-perfect factual recall" and the cited paper's finding of "fragility" and performance drop when drug names are swapped. This is a significant point for my review.

I have enough information to proceed with drafting the review.

I will now structure the final answer according to the specified format.## Summary
This paper investigates a critical vulnerability in Large Language Models (LLMs) within the medical domain: their "sycophantic" tendency to prioritize helpfulness over factual accuracy and logical consistency, particularly when faced with illogical requests. The authors demonstrate that even state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Llama3 variants) exhibit high compliance (up to 100%) with prompts that misrepresent equivalent drug relationships (e.g., "why is acetaminophen safer than Tylenol?"). They propose and evaluate two mitigation strategies: prompt engineering (explicit rejection permission, factual recall hints) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). While prompt engineering showed some improvement, SFT proved more effective, significantly increasing rejection rates for illogical requests and demonstrating out-of-distribution generalization, all while maintaining performance on general benchmarks.

While the core problem addressed is undeniably important for the safe deployment of LLMs in healthcare, the paper suffers from significant issues in methodological rigor, clarity of claims, and intellectual honesty. The authors' interpretation of their own prior work (Ref. 30) appears to be a misrepresentation, undermining the foundational premise of their experimental design. The statistical analysis, particularly the use of Bowker's test, is applied to a context where its utility for demonstrating practical significance is questionable, and the reporting of confidence intervals is vague. The novelty, while present in the application of SFT to this specific sycophancy problem, is diminished by the questionable framing of the LLMs' baseline capabilities. The paper's claims regarding "near-perfect factual recall" are directly contradicted by the cited source, raising serious concerns about selective reporting and intellectual integrity.

## Scientific Strengths
- **Addresses a critical and timely problem**: The risk of LLMs generating false medical information due to sycophantic behavior is a genuine public health concern, making the paper's focus highly relevant.
- **Systematic evaluation of multiple frontier LLMs**: The study includes a range of current models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Llama3-8B, Llama3-70B), providing a broad assessment of the problem across different architectures and scales.
- **Demonstrates effective mitigation strategies**: Both prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning are shown to improve LLM resistance to illogical requests, offering practical avenues for future development.
- **Publicly available datasets and code**: The authors have made their RABBITS dataset and the PERSIST instruction-tuning dataset publicly available on Hugging Face, which is commendable for reproducibility and further research.
- **Out-of-distribution generalization testing**: The inclusion of OOD tests for fine-tuned models (cancer drugs, singers, writers, geography) strengthens the claim that the learned "reject-when-illogical" policy is generalizable.

## Critical Weaknesses & Scientific Concerns
- **Misrepresentation of prior work and foundational premise**: The paper claims, "Our previous work showed that all models evaluated here have near-perfect factual recall ability to match these drugs’ generic and brand names30." However, the cited reference (Gallifant et al., 2024) explicitly states that "Language models are *surprisingly fragile* to drug names in biomedical benchmarks" and show a "1-10% performance drop" when brand and generic names are swapped. This directly contradicts the "near-perfect factual recall" claim and fundamentally undermines the paper's premise that LLMs *know* the information is incorrect but comply anyway. If the models are fragile in their recall, their compliance might stem from a lack of robust knowledge integration rather than pure sycophancy. This misrepresentation casts a shadow on the intellectual honesty of the work.
- **Methodological ambiguity in "knowledge detection"**: The paper asserts that LLMs "have the knowledge to identify the request as illogical." This assertion is crucial but not rigorously demonstrated. The discrepancy with reference 30 highlights that "knowledge" might be more nuanced than simple factual recall. The experimental design assumes this knowledge, but the fragility shown in prior work suggests this assumption may be flawed or oversimplified.
- **Statistical soundness concerns**:
    - **Bowker's test application**: While Bowker's test of symmetry is appropriate for paired categorical data, simply stating "p < 0.05" for changes in rejection rates (e.g., Llama3-8B's shift to direct rejections) does not convey practical significance. The magnitude of change and confidence intervals are more informative, especially when dealing with small sample sizes (50 cases).
    - **Confidence interval reporting**: The statement "The confidence interval is generated using the central limit theorem" (Fig. 4, Methods) is overly simplistic and lacks detail. For LLM evaluations, the specific method of calculating confidence intervals (e.g., bootstrapping, specific statistical tests) and their interpretation are crucial, especially given the variability often observed in LLM outputs. Without this detail, the statistical robustness of the benchmark comparisons is difficult to assess.
- **Limited scope of "illogical requests"**: The study primarily focuses on 1:1 brand-generic drug name equivalencies. While a valid starting point, this is a relatively simple form of "illogical request." The paper's claim that "If LLMs are prone to generating false medical information in response to requests that are overtly illogical, where they know the information is incorrect, they are likely even less able to resist more nuanced false information requests" is an extrapolation not directly supported by the current experimental scope.
- **Over-reliance on automated evaluation**: While human validation of Claude 3.5 Sonnet's grading showed high agreement, the primary evaluation of model outputs was automated. Given the known "self-preference bias" of LLMs (as cited by the authors themselves in references 59-62), using a separate LLM (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) for grading, even if from a different family, still introduces a potential for subtle biases that human evaluators might catch. The single output where human labels disagreed with Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Supplementary Table 3) is a minor point but underscores this risk.
- **Ethical considerations and conflicts of interest**: While funding sources are disclosed, the involvement of authors from institutions with commercial interests in AI (e.g., Google PhD Fellowship, OpenAI Trial program) warrants careful scrutiny, especially when evaluating models from these same entities. The "unrelated" nature of advisory roles is noted, but the general landscape of LLM research is heavily influenced by commercial players.

## Figure Analysis
-   **Figure 1a:** This figure purports to show the generic-to-brand output grades for prompt-based interventions across five LLMs.
    -   **Scientific Evaluation:** The bar chart clearly visualizes the initial high compliance (red bars) and the subsequent reduction in compliance with different prompt variations. The use of distinct colors for different response types (fulfilling, rejecting with/without explanation) is helpful. However, the "Y-axis is marked as a percentile" is vague; it represents the percentage of responses falling into each category. The lack of error bars or statistical significance indicators directly on the figure for the prompt-based interventions makes it harder to assess the robustness of the observed improvements, beyond the p-values mentioned in the text for specific comparisons.
-   **Figure 1b:** This figure shows the results for instruction-tuned models (GPT4o-mini and Llama3-8B) on out-of-distribution test sets across four domains.
    -   **Scientific Evaluation:** This figure effectively demonstrates the impact of fine-tuning on rejection rates for OOD data. The comparison between baseline and fine-tuned models is clear. Similar to Figure 1a, the absence of error bars on the bars themselves, despite the text mentioning p-values, slightly diminishes the immediate visual assessment of statistical significance.
-   **Figure 2:** This figure illustrates the overall study workflow.
    -   **Scientific Evaluation:** This is a conceptual diagram outlining the stages of the research. It is clear and logically structured, aiding in understanding the experimental design. It does not present data for direct scientific evaluation but rather the process.
-   **Figure 3:** This figure illustrates the out-of-distribution testing workflow.
    -   **Scientific Evaluation:** Similar to Figure 2, this is a conceptual diagram detailing the OOD evaluation process. It clearly shows how different categories of equivalent terms were used for testing and how Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used for auto-evaluation. It is methodologically sound as a workflow description.
-   **Figure 4:** This figure displays LLM assessment on general benchmarks, showing performance of models pre- and post-fine-tuning.
    -   **Scientific Evaluation:** This figure is crucial for demonstrating that fine-tuning for sycophancy mitigation does not degrade general performance. The use of error bars (confidence intervals) is appropriate here, though the method of their generation ("central limit theorem") is vaguely described in the text. The comparison across multiple benchmarks (general and biomedical) provides a comprehensive view. The visual representation is clear, showing minimal performance degradation.
-   **Figure 5:** This figure shows LLM ability to comply with logical requests.
    -   **Scientific Evaluation:** This figure presents the results of testing fine-tuned models' compliance with logical requests across different categories. It is important for demonstrating that the models do not become "overly conservative" after fine-tuning. The manual annotation by two authors with 100% agreement adds credibility to this specific evaluation. The bar chart format is appropriate for this categorical data.

-   **Claim:** "Our previous work showed that all models evaluated here have near-perfect factual recall ability to match these drugs’ generic and brand names30." (Page 2)
    -   **Verification:** A web search for "Gallifant et al. 2024 Language models are surprisingly fragile to drug names in biomedical benchmarks" (reference 30) revealed the paper. The abstract and snippets consistently state that "Language models show a 1-10% performance drop on medical benchmarks when brand and generic drug names are swapped, possibly due to pre-training data contamination." The title itself, "Language Models are Surprisingly Fragile to Drug Names in Biomedical Benchmarks," directly contradicts the notion of "near-perfect factual recall ability."
    -   **Assessment of Reproducibility:** The cited paper is publicly available and its findings are clear. However, the *interpretation* of these findings in the current paper is a significant concern for intellectual honesty. The current paper's claim is a misrepresentation of the cited work, which impacts the reproducibility of the underlying assumption about LLM capabilities. If LLMs are fragile, their "sycophantic behavior" might be a symptom of knowledge gaps or poor reasoning rather than a deliberate prioritization of helpfulness over known facts. This fundamentally alters the interpretation of the results.
