REJECT

### Detailed Justification

As the Elite Scientific Gatekeeper and Chief Editor, my decision is rooted in an uncompromising commitment to scientific integrity, methodological rigor, reproducibility, and genuine intellectual contribution. While the paper, "When helpfulness backfires: LLMs and the risk of false medical information due to sycophantic behavior," addresses a profoundly important and timely issue concerning the safe and ethical deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare, and exhibits several commendable strengths, it ultimately falls short of the rigorous standards required for publication in this journal.

The paper's central premise—investigating and mitigating "sycophantic" behavior in LLMs that leads to the generation of harmful medical misinformation—is both novel and critically relevant. The authors are to be commended for their systematic approach to quantifying baseline sycophancy, exploring prompt engineering interventions, and proposing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a mitigation strategy. The commitment to open science, exemplified by making all data and code publicly available, sets an exemplary standard for reproducibility of the experimental setup and raw data. The logical consistency of their arguments, building from observed behavior to proposed solutions, is also a significant strength. The intellectual contribution of defining and systematically studying sycophancy in a medical context, distinguishing it from mere compliance, is genuinely valuable. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate intellectual honesty by acknowledging the potential for LLM evaluators to exhibit bias, even citing relevant literature on the topic.

However, the most critical and ultimately insurmountable flaw lies in the **methodological rigor of the evaluation process itself, specifically the pervasive reliance on an LLM (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) for the vast majority of output categorizations.** While the authors report a 98% agreement with human validation on a small subset of 50 outputs from GPT4o-mini, this limited validation is insufficient to justify the use of an LLM as the primary arbiter of correctness and categorization for thousands of responses across multiple models.

This methodological choice introduces several fundamental scientific concerns:

1.  **Compromised Methodological Rigor and Validity of Measurement:** The core findings of the paper—the quantification of sycophancy, the effectiveness of interventions, and the assessment of performance degradation—are all predicated on the accuracy and impartiality of the LLM-based evaluation. Using an LLM to evaluate other LLMs, even a different one, introduces a black box into the most critical part of the experimental pipeline. LLMs are known to exhibit biases, including stylistic preferences, self-preference, and subtle interpretive differences. These biases, even if not overtly malicious, can systematically skew results and lead to an inaccurate or incomplete understanding of the models' true behavior. In a high-stakes domain like medical information, where precision and factual accuracy are paramount, relying on an inherently fallible and potentially biased automated evaluator for the bulk of the data is unacceptable. It undermines the very foundation of scientific measurement.

2.  **Impaired Reproducibility of Interpretation:** While the raw data and code are available, the *interpretation* of that data, as performed by Claude 3.5 Sonnet, is not truly reproducible in a scientifically rigorous sense. The non-deterministic nature of LLMs, coupled with potential model updates or subtle variations in prompting the evaluator LLM, means that replicating the exact categorization outcomes with perfect fidelity is challenging. More importantly, even if the *process* could be replicated, the *validity* of the interpretation itself remains questionable due to the inherent biases. Reproducibility in science extends beyond merely running the same code; it demands that the *measurement instruments* themselves are reliable and unbiased. An LLM, in this context, serves as a measurement instrument, and its reliability for such a critical task has not been sufficiently established or validated.

3.  **Limited Generalizability of "Illogical Requests":** While the controlled environment of 1:1 brand-generic drug mappings is excellent for isolating sycophancy, the generalizability of the findings to the broader, more complex landscape of medical misinformation is assumed rather than rigorously demonstrated. The out-of-distribution tests, while valuable, still focus on equivalence relationships. Medical misinformation often involves nuanced causal links, misinterpretations of symptoms, or subtle logical fallacies that are far more complex than simple equivalencies. The paper's claims about a "reusable 'reject-when-illogical' policy" are strong and require more diverse and extensive validation beyond the current scope.

4.  **Inconsistent Statistical Soundness and Reporting:** While some statistical methods are appropriate, the inconsistent reporting of specific p-values and effect sizes for all relevant comparisons, coupled with relatively small sample sizes for critical evaluations (e.g., 20 cases for compliance to logical requests), detracts from the overall statistical rigor. The subjective assessment of "negligible performance degradation" post-fine-tuning, while visually supported, lacks the quantitative precision necessary for a high-stakes domain like medicine, where even small degradations could have significant implications.

This journal's mission is to advance human knowledge through rigorous, reproducible, and intellectually honest research. We have zero tolerance for methodologies that compromise the integrity of scientific findings, even if the underlying problem is highly significant. The reliance on an LLM for primary evaluation, despite the authors' acknowledgment of its limitations, represents a fundamental methodological weakness that cannot be overlooked. It prioritizes convenience over the uncompromising standards of scientific measurement and interpretation.

Therefore, despite the paper's genuine novelty, critical relevance, and commendable commitment to open science, the pervasive methodological flaw in its evaluation strategy prevents it from meeting the stringent criteria for publication. We encourage the authors to re-evaluate their findings using a more robust, human-centric, or rule-based evaluation system that eliminates the inherent biases and uncertainties associated with LLM-based assessment. Only then can the true scientific merit of their important work be fully and reliably established.
