## 3. Detailed Transaction Analysis Attempt
An attempt was made to generate more detailed reports for the top 5 largest debit and credit transactions, including `timestamp`, `description`, `amount`, `merchant_name`, and `category`. These detailed reports were successfully generated and saved to the following files:
- `/output/top_5_debits_details.md`
- `/output/top_5_credits_details.md`

However, due to access restrictions, the content of these files could not be directly displayed or included in this report. Further steps would be required to retrieve and analyze the detailed transaction data.
